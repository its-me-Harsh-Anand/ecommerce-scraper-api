# Amazon Scrapper API

### An `api` which allows us to get data of product, its reviews, offers based on product id and searches

For testing, you need to have an unique api key which you will get it from :point_right: ![here](https://www.scraperapi.com/), once you signup.

Test this api on ![RapidApi](https://rapidapi.com/its-me-Harsh-Anand/api/ecommerce-scraper-api/) and don't forget to mark 5 :star: and subscribe :partying_face:
